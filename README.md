# Citygen V1.0
 City generator with people, events and more. 

This city generator is the first version of a longer term planned civilization generator. This is for coding example only, however the code is tested and works. 

The city generator is designed to create every part of a working city, from the people that live there, the events that shape the city, the leadership, and threats to the city. 

The generation system is based on the town generation systems created in the Dungeons and Dragons Version 3.5 system.
